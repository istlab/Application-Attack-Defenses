\begin{abstract}
In this paper we examine how intrusion-detection
systems developed to counter a specific category
of application attacks are developed and presented to
the research community.

\section{Introduction}

Introduction~\cite{I05}. Also see~\cite{A00}.

Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Flexibility} We check if an approach
can be adjusted in order to detect different {\sc cia} categories.
\item {\bf Ease of use} We examine if the mechanism that
implements an approach is practical and can be easily adopted
by security experts.
\item {\bf Effectiveness} As long as we examine security
mechanisms that detect either attacks or defects,
the non-existence of false positive and negative alarms
is a reasonable requirement.
\item {\bf Efficiency} Finally, we examine
the computational overhead of the mechanisms that affect the experience of
a web user who actually uses the protected application.
\item {\bf Security} How resilient is the system to
attacks made to to circumvent it.
\end{itemize}
All the aforementioned requirements are considered critical
when building security mechanisms that protect
applications~\cite{A01,A00}.

The evaluation of 

\section{Analysis Dimensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Sensitivity}, the probability that an attack will be
  caught.
\item {\bf Specificity}, the probability that a normal interaction
  will test negative.
\item {\bf Positive Predictive Value} (PPV), the probability that a
  reported attack is a real attack.
\item {\bf Negative Predictive Value} (NPV), the probability that if
  nothing is reported no attack has taken place.
\end{itemize}

To do any meaningful calculation of the above, we need to define
precisely the following in our methodology:
\begin{itemize}
\item True Positive (TP)
\item False Positive (FP)
\item True Negative (TN)
\item False Negative (FN)
\end{itemize}

\section{Intrusion Detection Accuracy}

An intrusion detection system examines some software artifact and
reports vulnerabilities. The value an intrusion detection system can
be measured in terms of its \emph{accuracy}, which gauges the quality
of its output. An intrusion detection system:
\begin{itemize}
\item A prediction about a vulnerability is true. That is a \emph{true
    positive}. 
\item A prediction about a vulnerability is false; intrusion
  detection reported something that in reality is not vulnerability.
  That is a \emph{false positive}.
\item A prediction about the absence of a vulnerability is true. That
  is a \emph{true negative}: intrusion detection evaluated something
  as being safe, and it is.
\item A prediction about the absence of a vulnerability is false. That
  is a \emph{false negative}: intrusion detection missed a
  vulnerability.
\end{itemize}
In terms of the above, the \emph{Positive Predictive Value} (PPV) is
defined as the ratio of true positives over all reported positives,
while the \emph{Negative Predictive Value} (NPV) is defined as the
ratio of true negatives over all reported negatives. In intrusion
detection, the PPV is an indicator of how much we should be worried
about a reported vulnerability being true. Conversely, the NPV is an
indicator of how much we should be reassured when no vulnerabilities
are reported.

What we need to proceed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the studies report the sample size? Note that we must be
  careful with what we mean by sample size. A single item in the
  sample is something that can be vulnerable or not. 
\item Do the studies report true positives, false positives, true
  negatives, false negatives?
\end{itemize}


\section{Covered Area}

We decided to narrow down our
research to countermeasures developed to
detect attacks that target applications. Such attacks include
buffer overflow attacks~\cite{K11}, {\sc sql} injection
attacks~\cite{RL12b}, cross-site scripting ({\sc xss})
attacks~\cite{SG07}, cross-site request forgery ({\sc csrf})
attacks~\cite{LZRL09} and others.
Such attacks top the vulnerability lists of numerous bulletin providers for several
years.\footnote{\url{http://www.sans.org/top-cyber-security-risks/}, \url{http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/}}
Consider the {\sc owasp}\footnote{\url{https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project}}
(Open Web Application Security Project)
Top Ten project whose main goal is to raise awareness about
web application security by identifying some of the most critical risks facing
organizations which is referenced by numerous researchers.
In its three consecutive Top Ten lists (2007, 2010, 2013), different
source code-driven injection attacks dominate the top five positions.
This indicates that
apart from the fact that malicious users find new ways to bypass
defense mechanisms by using a variety of techniques despite the numerous
countermeasures that are being introduced.
Note that the number of systems developed to counter {\sc sql}
injection attacks until 2006 was more than twenty~\cite{HVO06}.
Since then the number has doubled.
In our research we focus on the top {\sc tba} systems that counter
application attacks, in terms of citations.
