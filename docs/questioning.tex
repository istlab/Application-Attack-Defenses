\section{Introduction}

Introduction~\cite{I05}. Also see~\cite{A00}.

Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Flexibility} We check if an approach
can be adjusted in order to detect different {\sc cia} categories.
\item {\bf Ease of use} We examine if the mechanism that
implements an approach is practical and can be easily adopted
by security experts.
\item {\bf Effectiveness} As long as we examine security
mechanisms that detect either attacks or defects,
the non-existence of false positive and negative alarms
is a reasonable requirement.
\item {\bf Efficiency} Finally, we examine
the computational overhead of the mechanisms that affect the experience of
a web user who actually uses the protected application.
\item {\bf Security} How resilient is the system to
attacks made to to circumvent it.
\end{itemize}
All the aforementioned requirements are considered critical
when building security mechanisms that protect
applications~\cite{A01,A00}.

The evaluation of 

\section{Analysis Dimensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Sensitivity}, the probability that an attack will be
  caught.
\item {\bf Specificity}, the probability that a normal interaction
  will test negative.
\item {\bf Positive Predictive Value} (PPV), the probability that a
  reported attack is a real attack.
\item {\bf Negative Predictive Value} (NPV), the probability that if
  nothing is reported no attack has taken place.
\end{itemize}

To do any meaningful calculation of the above, we need to define
precisely the following in our methodology:
\begin{itemize}
\item True Positive (TP)
\item False Positive (FP)
\item True Negative (TN)
\item False Negative (FN)
\end{itemize}

\section{Intrusion Detection Accuracy}

An intrusion detection system examines some software artifact and
reports vulnerabilities. The value an intrusion detection system can
be measured in terms of its \emph{accuracy}, which gauges the quality
of its output. An intrusion detection system:
\begin{itemize}
\item A prediction about a vulnerability is true. That is a \emph{true
    positive}. 
\item A prediction about a vulnerability is false; intrusion
  detection reported something that in reality is not vulnerability.
  That is a \emph{false positive}.
\item A prediction about the absence of a vulnerability is true. That
  is a \emph{true negative}: intrusion detection evaluated something
  as being safe, and it is.
\item A prediction about the absence of a vulnerability is false. That
  is a \emph{false negative}: intrusion detection missed a
  vulnerability.
\end{itemize}
In terms of the above, the \emph{Positive Predictive Value} (PPV) is
defined as the ratio of true positives over all reported positives,
while the \emph{Negative Predictive Value} (NPV) is defined as the
ratio of true negatives over all reported negatives. In intrusion
detection, the PPV is an indicator of how much we should be worried
about a reported vulnerability being true. Conversely, the NPV is an
indicator of how much we should be reassured when no vulnerabilities
are reported.

What we need to proceed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the studies report the sample size? Note that we must be
  careful with what we mean by sample size. A single item in the
  sample is something that can be vulnerable or not. 
\item Do the studies report true positives, false positives, true
  negatives, false negatives?
\end{itemize}


\section{Covered Area}

We decided to narrow down our
research to countermeasures developed to
detect attacks that target applications. Such attacks include
buffer overflow attacks~\cite{K11}, {\sc sql} injection
attacks~\cite{RL12b}, cross-site scripting ({\sc xss})
attacks~\cite{SG07}, cross-site request forgery ({\sc csrf})
attacks~\cite{LZRL09} and others.
Such attacks top the vulnerability lists of numerous bulletin providers for several
years.\footnote{\url{http://www.sans.org/top-cyber-security-risks/}, \url{http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/}}
Consider the {\sc owasp}\footnote{\url{https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project}}
(Open Web Application Security Project)
Top Ten project whose main goal is to raise awareness about
web application security by identifying some of the most critical risks facing
organizations which is referenced by numerous researchers.
In its three consecutive Top Ten lists (2007, 2010, 2013), different
source code-driven injection attacks dominate the top five positions.
This indicates that
apart from the fact that malicious users find new ways to bypass
defense mechanisms by using a variety of techniques despite the numerous
countermeasures that are being introduced.
Note that the number of systems developed to counter {\sc sql}
injection attacks until 2006 was more than twenty~\cite{HVO06}.
Since then the number has doubled.
In our research we focus on the top {\sc tba} systems that counter
application attacks, in terms of citations.

\section{Analysis}

{\sc na} means that a requirement is not even mentioned in the paper.
{\sc nq} indicates that a requirement is mentioned in the publication
but it is not quantified.

Notes on taint tools:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The accuracy testing of {\sc csse}~\cite{PB05} was based on 
defects found in the security mailing
list: {\it Bugtraq}\footnote{\url{http://seclists.org/bugtraq/}}.
\item During their evaluation, the authors of~\cite{HCF05} have only performed
two attacks in one synthetic benchmark ({\sc owasp}'s
{\it WebGoat}\footnote{\url{https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project}}).
\item The testing in~\cite{XBS06} was made based on
defects with specific {\sc cve id}s.
\item The authors of {\it {\sc wasc}}~\cite{NLC07}
mention the vulnerabilities (specific {\sc cve id}s)
exploited and the corresponding applications but they do not explicitly
state how many attacks they launched (``{\it [...] launched a variety of
attacks against it}").
\item The authors of~\cite{VFJKKV07} do the same.
However, even if they do not mention specific {\sc cve id}s,
they browsed applications without performing attacks.
\item Even if the authors of {\it Noxes}~\cite{KKVJ06,KJKV09} state in
both papers that ``{\it [...] we are planning to make the tool available as
a freeware utility}." the tool cannot be found anywhere on the Internet.
The vulnerabilities exploited during testing were reported
by {\it Bugtraq}\footnote{\url{http://seclists.org/bugtraq/}}.
\item {\it {\sc php} Aspis}~\cite{PMP11} was tested on only one
application (Wordpress 2.9.2) with multiple vulnerabilities (specific {\sc cve id}s).
\item During their initial tests, the authors of
managed to bypass the browser-based {\sc xss} filters of the
73\% of 1,602 real-world {\sc dom}-based {\sc xss} vulnerabilities.
Then they proposed an approach that detected all the attacks they
found (1169). This is a complex paper --- we need to elaborate.
\end{enumerate}

Notes on {\sc isr} mechanisms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it {\sc sql}rand}~\cite{BK04}: Both exploits from {\sc cve}.
\item {\it Noncespaces}~\cite{GC09} was only tested on one
known vulnerable application (TikiWiki). The authors mention that they performed
a number of attacks but they do not state how many.
\item The authors of {\it x{\sc js}}~\cite{APKLM10}, have tested
their mechanisms based on real-world attacks coming from
{\sc xss}ed.com.\footnote{www.xssed.com}
\end{enumerate}

Notes on policy enforcement tools:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Just like the authors of {\it x{\sc js}~\cite{APKLM10},
the authors of {\sc dsi}}~\cite{NSS06}, have tested
their mechanisms based on real-world attacks coming from
{\sc xss}ed.com.\footnote{www.xssed.com}
\item The testing of {\it BrowserShield}~\cite{RDWDE07}
involved {\sc xss} vulnerabilities reported by Microsoft
in 2005.\footnote{\url{https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin}}
The link currently shows defects for 2014.
\item {\it CoreScript}~\cite{YCIS07} is more of a programming
language\footnote{``[...] uses program instrumentation for
JavaScript where untrusted JavaScript
code goes through a rewriting process according to a security policy
before executing them in the browser"~\cite{PSC09}.}
than an {\sc IDS}.
\item Surprisingly, {\sc met}~\cite{ELX07} was not tested at all.
\item {\sc beep}~\cite{TNH07}'s test suite was based on 61 {\sc xss}
attack vectors published by \url{ha.ckers.org}.
\item {\sc soma}~\cite{OWVS08} --- all synthetics.
\item The attacks used for the testing of {\it Blueprint}~\cite{LV09},
came from \url{ha.ckers.org}.
\item {\it Phung et al.}~\cite{PSC09} also utilized \url{ha.ckers.org}.
\item {\it WebJail}~\cite{VDDPJ11} --- not tested at all.
\item {\it ConScript}~\cite{ML10} --- not tested at all. A scheme
similar to {\it CoreScript}~\cite{YCIS07}.
\item {\it j{\sc csrf}}~\cite{PS11} --- based on {\sc csrf}
defects with specific {\sc cve id}s.
\item The authors of {\it TreeHouse}~\cite{IW12} have tested
only the overhead and how easy is to incorporate the mechanism
into an application.
\end{enumerate}

Notes on training-based mechanisms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it {\sc didafit}}~\cite{LLW02} is one of
the first {\sc ids}.
\item {\sc amnesia}~\cite{HO05,HO06,HO05b} was tested
on applications with known vulnerabilities taken
from \url{http://gotocode.com} plus two synthetic benchmarks.
Interestingly, in one of the papers~\cite{HO06},
the authors mention that the tool can produce both {\sc fp} and
{\sc fn}.
\item {\it libAnomaly}~\cite{VMV05} --- one application tested ({\sc php}-Nuke).
\item {\sc sqlg}uard~\cite{BWS05} --- no testing at all.
